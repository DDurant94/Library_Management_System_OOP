# Library Managment System Project

Author: Daniel Durant

User:
This is a user-friendly command-line interface for a library. This program can be scaled and easily navigated by following the menu options and promps.
Easy for the user to move from menu to menu without any problems. Errors are handled in the background and lets the user know if 
they have enterd something wrong or not. Following all the promps and menu options the user has nothing to worry about but entering in new information.

Code:
This Class can easily be built appon. All the classes are labeled for easy follow along code. If you wanted to add a new feature it's as easy as writing a couple lines. Follow the path from The UI
interface and add the new feature in the appropriate class that is set up. All of the information is stored in text files for safe keeping. The information is saved when exiting a 
menu or after editing a book. This allows the user to not lose any of the information while running the program. 

This project was a lot of fun for me to make. I strengthened my skills within file handling and OOP. Best project that I have done so far.
